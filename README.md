# LongTermCareCoin
Trusted Long-Term Care Placement Market - Ethereum Smart Contract &amp; Web API

This repository contains a Solidity-based Ethereum smart contract integrated with a web-based API and web library to support a trusted, transparent marketplace for long-term care placements. The system is designed to streamline the process of matching individuals seeking long-term care services with verified providers, ensuring security, trust, and ease of use.

Use Case:  Long-Term Care Coin seeks to leverage blockchain and smart contracts to codify clear agency relationships with care seekers. In the long-term care market, as in real estate, a single agent is associated with a care seeker through both informal and formal processes.  Generally, the first agent to connect with a care seeker will have agency. Blockchain technology provides a trust approach in the long-term care marketplace to securely and transparently match a agent to a care seeker.   

Features:
Decentralized Trust: Ethereum blockchain ensures that all transactions and interactions are immutable and verifiable.
Smart Contract Automation: Automates the process of connecting care seekers with trusted care providers based on pre-established conditions.

Web API: Provides a RESTful API for interacting with the smart contract, allowing seamless integration with external systems or front-end applications.

Transparency and Accountability: All contract terms, transactions, and reviews are recorded on-chain for full transparency and auditability.

Privacy and Security: Leverages blockchain encryption and best practices for handling sensitive information.
Technology Stack:

Solidity: Smart contract programming language. (check the version)

Ethereum (or EVM supported Blockchain): Blockchain platform for decentralized deployment.

OpenZeppelin: Secure, reusable contract modules.

Truffle (Remix was used https://remix.ethereum.org/): Development environment for testing and deploying contracts.

Web3.js / Ethers.js: Web libraries for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain via a browser.

Use Cases:

Long-term Care Agents: Providing clear agency relationships with care seekers. In the long-term care market as in real-estate, a single agent is associated with a care seeker through both informal and formal processes.  Generally, the first agent to connect with a care seeker will have agency.  

Users:
Care Seekers: Find and engage with verified care providers in a transparent, secure, and decentralized environment.

Care Providers: Build trust and transparency by having immutable records of service and reputation on the blockchain.

Families and Caregivers: Manage care services with assurance using secure payments and smart contract logic.

Getting Started:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies.
  3. Deploy the Solidity smart contract using Truffle on Ethereum or a local testnet.
  4. Set up the web-based API using Node.js and Express for interaction with the smart contract.
  5. Use the provided web library (Web3.js) to integrate with your front-end application.
  6. Interact with the system via Metamask for seamless blockchain transactions.

API Endpoints:
  1. GET /providers: Fetch a list of verified care providers.
  2. POST /create-contract: Create a new long-term care smart contract.
  
Future Development:
  1. Longterm Care Marketplace: Build out an ecosystem to support the LongTermCare Coin
  2. AI Matching: Integrate machine learning algorithms to optimize provider-patient matching.
  3. Expanded Services: Extend beyond long-term care to include other health and wellness services
  4. DeFi Integration: Enable advanced payment options using decentralized finance.
